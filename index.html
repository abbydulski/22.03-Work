            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Tasked with improving the current data logger system used by the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana</li>
                    <li> The reservation uses the data loggers for research purposes</li>
                    <li> Data loggers are typically set up facing each other 15 ft apart</li>
                    <li> Components of the current logger are rebar, a camera trap, an audio recorder, and batteries</li>
                    <li> Current system is inefficient and laborous</li>
                    <li> Using solar panels, a voltage booster, and soldering a cutting of the components wires we were able to come up with a new system resolving many of the complications of the current one</li>
                    <li> New system components are rebar, a camera trap, an audio recorder, a solar panel pack, and a portable charger</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

         <section>
            <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
            <p> We aim to address the problems below.
                <ul>
                    <li> The current system is not easy to assemble and carry </li>
                    <li> The current system is not safe from animals and bad weather</li>
                    <li> The current system requires battery maintenance </li> 
                    <li> Battery maintenance requires numerous treks to the data logger every recording period </li>
                    <li> The treks are unsafe to the researchers doing them</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>3. Project Goals</h2>
            <p>Our goals for the project are below. Completion of our goals will prevent the need for frequent visits to the site to replace batteries and it will make sure the equipment is not damaged by animals or bad weather. 
                <ul>
                    <li> Integrate a self-powered mechanism for the data logger</li>
                    <li> Design a more robust carrier of the equipment</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>4. Project Timeline</h2>
            <p>A rough timeline of our porject is below:
                <ul>
                    <li> Prioritize issues with the data logger</li>
                    <li> Design the mechanical structure to meet this goal</li>
                    <li> Design the electronic structure to meet this goal</li>
                    <li> Test the designs</li>
                    <li> Commit and build out the best design</li>
                </ul>
            <br>Key milestones in the project are below:
                <ul>
                    <li> 3D printing of the camera and audio holder</li>
                    <li> Analysis of the power needs of a circuit connecting the system of components</li>
                    <li> Integration of the battery and the solar panel</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>5. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <p>A description of the process followed to build the project is below:
                <ul>
                    <li> Analyzed the circuit of the camera to uncover it needs 12V of power</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the circuit of the audio component to unvocer it needs 5V of power</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the power privided by the solar panel and the portable charger</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the amount of current procuded by the solar panel</li>
                </ul>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used are below:
                <ul>
                    <li> Fusion 360 for design of parts</li>
                    <li> Original Prusa i3 3D printer </li>
                    <li> Soldered electronic components</li>
                </ul>
            <br>Challenges in the process faced and their solutions are outlined below:
            <ul>
                <li> Camera component needs 12V of power, but the battery only provides 5V of power</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> We solved this problem by using a voltage booster</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The audio component was not driving enough current originally at all times originally to keep it on</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> We used a converter card in the audio component</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The solar panel needs to be at an angle and the solar panel and battery need to be a single part</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Designed a part with a cage for the battery and a 45 degree inclined platform to hold the solar panel</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The whole system needs to be held on a single rebar and the parts need to be able to be attached to the rebar</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Parts have a nut and bolt attachment that holds them stable onto the rebar</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>6. Results</h2>
            <p> Images of our new system are below, as well as a diagram showing how all of the parts are connected electronically. This new system reinforces the water resistivity of the system, is more robust and easier to assemble, and is self-sustained through the solar panel and external portable charger eliminating the need for battery replacement mid recording periods.
