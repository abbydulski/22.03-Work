            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>For the 22.03 final project, we were tasked with improving the current data logger system used by the Blackfeet Indian Reservation
            in northern Montana. The old system included a camera trap and an audio recorder placed on rebar. The old system powers both of the components 
            with batteries. This forces one to go replace the batteries multiple times within one recording period. These loggers are often set up in locations
            that require a trecherous trek to reach, making replacing the battery a massive burden. We have designed a new data logger that eliminates the need 
            for these components to be powered by batteries and allows for the components to recieve charge through one whole recording cycle, eliminating
            the need for anyone to have to replace the batteries and hence reducing the number of times the researchers must make the trek to the logger. 
            We have done this by electronically connecting the camera trap and audio recorder to a portable charger that we have connected to a solar panel. 
            This allows for the sun to power the solar panel which in turn powers the portable charger which in turn powers the audio and camera recorders. 
            To make all of these connections, we had to break down each component and assess how to manipulate components to allow for the portable charger to power them.
            This required using a voltage booster and cutting and soldering many wires within the components. We additionally had to design parts to hold both the 
            solar panels and the portable charger to the rebar. Most of the recording is done in the summer months of Montana, which allows for us to be certain that the
            solar panels will be recieving enough sun to supply the voltage we need at all times (~5V). </p>
