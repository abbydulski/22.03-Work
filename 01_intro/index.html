-  Wednesday class: Meet Jordan
        1. Learn more about the project
        2. Make a plan

- Meeting with Jordan
        1. Do you have already a device that you want us to improve or we will start from scratch?
        A. The device already exist. They just need some improvement, especially making it more autonomous.
        2. What additional features would you want us to bring to your system?
        A. There are a lot of bear activities. Making a robust carrier (3d printed? ) would be appreciated (devices are expensive, it would be nice to have them safe for a long time).
        3. Are there other limitations your current device has?
        A. Need to manually change the battery (current batteries last about 140 hours). - need to have another recharging system (solar panel ??). Constrains on data storage - we can considere more robust SD cards but having a remote data transfer system would be more efficient (Heavy data (video, audio files), accoustic data can be checked with frequency); Can think about designing a local precipitation sensor - a magnetic system to pull out and to insert battery using drones?? Currently mobile service provider: verizon - signel is pretty good. Buffalo pasture: higher priority. Human-free installation?? Would be useful for safer use of the system - Drones to do maintenance and to collect samples??; Developing a way to get update on the system remotely would be appreciated
        4. How high is the device off the ground?
        A. The camera is at your knee, and the audio recorder is above the camera
        5. Dimensions of the camera
        A. 5" * 5" * 2" box ?? (not sure if these are the correct dimensions).

  - To do:
      narrow down ideas and pick the ones we will work on over the semester.
