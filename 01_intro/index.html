### Meeting with Jordan

      | Questions | Answers |
      | ----------- | ----------- |
      | Do you have already a device that you want us to improve or we will start from scratch?  | The device already exist. They just need some improvement, especially making it more autonomous. |
      | What additional features would you want us to bring to your system? | There are a lot of bear activities. Making a robust carrier (3d printed? ) would be appreciated (devices are expensive, it would be nice to have them safe for a long time). |
      | Are there other limitations your current device has?  | Need to manually change the battery (current batteries last about 140 hours). - need to have another recharging system (solar panel ??). Constrains on data storage - we can considere more robust SD cards but having a remote data transfer system would be more efficient (Heavy data (video, audio files), accoustic data can be checked with frequency); Can think about designing a local precipitation sensor - a magnetic system to pull out and to insert battery using drones?? Currently mobile service provider: verizon - signel is pretty good. Buffalo pasture: higher priority. Human-free installation?? Would be useful for safer use of the system - Drones to do maintenance and to collect samples??; Developing a way to get update on the system remotely would be appreciated |
      | How high is the device off the ground? | The camera is at your knee, and the audio recorder is above the camera |
      | Dimensions of the camera | 5" * 5" * 2" box ?? (not sure if these are the correct dimensions). |

      To do:
      narrow down ideas and pick the ones we will work on over the semester.
