### Data Logger Considerations 


### Problem Statement

Environmental research is important for supporting the cultural goals of the Blackfeet (including buffalo rewilding to re-enable lost traditions, etc.). However, researchers must rely on off-the-shelf sensors that don't fit the requirements of many research projects. We should therefore develop a modular outdoor sensor system that includes (1) solar power source and battery, (2) data storage, and (3) is robust to unique environmental hazards (e.g., bears and buffalo). 


### Precedents 

What are currently available solutions? 

- https://makersportal.com/shop/solar-panel-datalogger-kit-for-arduino

### Parameters 

- What type of sensors are we concerned with? 
- How long should it work without sunlight (i.e. battery size)?
- How much data should it store (how often does it need to be visited)?
- Is there cellular data? Could it send updates remotely? (Also consider LoRa mesh network). 
- What types of environmental hazards? Wildlife, weather, etc.?
